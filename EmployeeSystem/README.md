# Employee Management System (Java OOP)

This project is a simple Java application that demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles through an employee management system.
It includes examples of inheritance, method overriding, encapsulation, and console-based program flow.

## 📌 Project Overview

The application allows users to perform actions on two types of employees:

Software Developer (Developer)

Manager

Each employee type has its own properties and custom methods, implemented using inheritance and polymorphism.

## 🧩 Features

Base class Employee holding shared attributes

Derived classes:

Developer (can install OS)

Manager (can give raises)

Console-driven menu system

Method overriding for displaying information

Encapsulation with getters/setters

Continuous interactive loop until user exits

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Java 8+

OOP Concepts

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Encapsulation

Method Overriding

Scanner-based console input

## 📁 Class Structure
src/
│
├── Employee.java
├── Developer.java
├── Manager.java
└── Main.java

## ▶️ How It Works

Program starts and welcomes the user.

User chooses:

Developer operations

Manager operations

Quit

Developer options:

Install OS

Show info

Manager options:

Give raise

Show info

Operations continue until user quits.

## 📷 Example Run

## 📌 Purpose of the Project

This project serves as a small but effective demonstration of Object-Oriented Programming fundamentals through a realistic employee-based scenario.
It is designed as a mini Java practice project for learning and teaching OOP.
